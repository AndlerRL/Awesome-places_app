# Awesome-places_app #

Awesome Places is an app where you can take pictures of places that you like and you want to share with others users, providing info about what it is in that place.

In this app decided to use React-Native, React 16.8, React-Redux/Redux, React-Native-Navigation & other dependencies, just because and my very very first app using React-Native, so, hope you like it!

At this point of the app, it has already some components and screens, such as:
  
  * __Find Places:__ where you can see all the places that you added, and it is like a 'dashboard' of places that you added previously.
  * __Share Places:__ Here is where you can upload and put locations with Google Maps API (not right now, but will do)
Find places, Share and Login. Right now doesn't have authentication, but will in the near future.
  * __Login Screen:__ Well, it's an auth screen, so it just have the basic to simulate a login (only Login button, actually)
  * __Sidedrawer:__ Functionallity of the SideDrawer screen is ready, but styling and redirecting is missing; will add soon.
