<h1>Awesome-places_app</h1>

<p>Awesome Places is an app where you can take pictures of places that you like and you want to share with others users, providing info about what it is in that place.</p>

<p>In this app decided to use React-Native, React 16.8, React-Redux/Redux, React-Native-Navigation & other dependencies, just because and my very very first app using React-Native, so, hope you like it!</p>
